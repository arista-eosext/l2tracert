#    Version 1.1  - 5/5/2015

#    Revision history:

#       1.1 - Added MAC and VLAN validation. Fixed minor bug. - 5/5/2015

""" l2tracert 
    The purpose of this script is to provide a traceroute function but at layer 2. The user must specify a destination MAC address
    and a VLAN. Additionally, LLDP must be enabled between the switches and they must leverage EAPI.
    If LLDP and or EAPI is not enabled, the script will stop at that switch hop.

    Additionally, the ma1 interface must have an IP and all neighbor Arista switches need to be reachable via the ma1 interface,
    since this is the IP that shows up in the LLDP management IP field.
    
    The script uses the output of the 'show mac address-table' command and LLDP information to build a hop by hop representation 
    of the l2 route from beginning to final egress switch port.
    In large Layer 2 environments, this can be helpful to understand each switch and physical interface  that is used to reach 
    a specific mac address, especially when troubleshooting.

    A user account must be created that has enough privilege to run the 'show mac address-table' and 'show lldp' commands.
    Either the variables DEFAULTUSER and DEFAULTPW will need to be set or command line arguments can be specified.

    To make it easier to execute from EOS, an alias can be setup to provide those required authentication paramenters.
    For example:
    7050S-64(config)#alias l2trace bash /mnt/flash/l2tracert.py -u admin -p mypassword 
    
    Now the alias l2trace can be used instead of having to type the username and password each time.
    7050S-64#l2trace -m 000e.c687.8c93 -v 1
    L2 Trace Route to 000e.c687.8c93 on VLAN 1
    
    Hop          Host             Egress           Remote Host      Ingress
